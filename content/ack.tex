Special thanks go to Hazelcast guys: Talip Ozturk, Fuad Malikov, Mehmet Dogan and Enes Akar that are technically responsible for Hazelcast and helped to answer my questions. Also thanks to all committers and mailinglist members for contributing to making Hazelcast such a great product.

Finally, I'm very grateful for my girlfriend Ralitsa Spasova for being a positive influence around me and making me a better person.
