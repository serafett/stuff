Special thanks go to Hazelcast guys: Talip Ozturk, Fuad Malikov, Enes Akar that are technically responsible for Hazelcast and helped to answer my questions. But I really want to thank Mehmet Dogan, Archtect at Hazelcast, since he was my main source of information and put up with the zillion questions I have asked.

Also thanks to all committers and mailinglist members for contributing to making Hazelcast such a great product.

Finally, I'm very grateful for my girlfriend Ralitsa Spasova for being a positive influence around me and making me a better person.
